#Prompt the user for an integer and store the value in a variable.

alpha = (input("enter your integer"))
print(alpha)

##Display the data type of the variable that holds the entered data.
print("The variable, name is of type:", type(alpha))

##Convert the value to an integer type and store the converted value in a new variable.

alpha = int(input("enter your integer"))
print("The variable, name is of type:", type(alpha))
##Display the value and type of the new variable in a single sentence. (For example, "The value is 8 with type integer.")
print(f"the value is {alpha} with", type(alpha))



##Run the program and enter a float value at the prompt. What is its value in the last step?


##Refactor the program, using a float instead of an integer. What happens if you enter an integer rather than a float at the prompt?
alpha = float(input("enter your integer"))
print(alpha)

##Display the data type of the variable that holds the entered data.
print("The variable, name is of type:", type(alpha))

##Convert the value to an integer type and store the converted value in a new variable.

alpha = (input("enter your integer")
print("The variable, name is of type:", type(alpha))
##Display the value and type of the new variable in a single sentence. (For example, "The value is 8 with type integer.")

##Create a computer program that prompts the user for a float number and returns the integer portion of the floating number.
import math

value = float(input("Enter a floating number: "))
print(math.floor(value))


##2.4
amt = float(input("please input your amount"))
int =float(input("please enter the interest"))

n = float(input("please enter the times"))

##2.5

##Write a computer program that prompts the user for a principal amount, the rate of interest, and the number of days for a loan and then calculates and returns the simple interest for the life of the loan. Use the formula:
principal = float(input("please input your amount"))
rate  = float(input("please input your interest"))
days = float(input("please enter your days"))

simpleinterest = principal*rate*0.01*days/365
print(simpleinterest)
