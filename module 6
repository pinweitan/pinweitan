##Run a command to see all the processes running on the server owned by everyone.
ps -ef

##Confirm the username you are running as.
echo $USER

##Run a command to see all the processes running on the server and use grep to select only the processes your user is running.
ps -ef | grep "root"

##Repeat the previous exercise. This time, select every process except things running as you.
ps -ef | grep -v "ubuntu"

##Show the process info for our current session without using a grep command.
ps -ef

##Show the process tree for the current session.
ps -ef f 

##Run a process check on the server but only output the User, pid and cmd columns to your results.
ps -o pid,cmd,user

##Run a process check to pull all of the process ids running on the server and put the output into a file named list in your home directory.
cd
ps > list

##Run the following series of commands:
sleep 300 &

##Find this command by checking the processes and running a grep
ps -ef f | grep "38090"

##Stop the process using the process id
kill -9

##Run a command to see a dynamic view of all the processes running on your host.
top 

##Now run the same command but specifically only for root.
top -u root

##Experiment with the following commands while running top and note your observations:

###z -> highlights running process and bring it to the top
###c -> show the processes aboslute path
###Shift+P ->  sort the processes by CPU %
###k -> prompts the process ID to kill

##Run a command to check network connectivity between your Linux session and yahoo.com.
ping yahoo.com

##show the network route between your session and yahoo.com and output the contents into a file named yahoo.route in your home directory.
cd
traceroute yahoo.com > yahoo.route

##View the file using less and see how many hops it took to get there.
24

##Create a soft link named route to your network route.
ln -s yahoo.route route

##Run a command to see all the network sockets on your server and output to a file named output in your home directory.
netstat > output 

##Create a folder named network in your home directory.
cd
mkdir network

##Move your route file and network output file into the network folder you just created.
mv route output ./network

##Run the command to query your network interfaces on your session.
ifconfig 

##Run the following command to put your results in the directory the trainer specified.
