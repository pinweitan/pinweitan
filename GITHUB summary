Terminal:
In the terminal, by queuing the changes:
###Initializing a new repo Type in what comes AFTER the $...do not type in the $

To create repo and initialzie git

$ git init
This command creates an empty git repository - basically a .git directory with subdirectories for objects, refs/heads, refs/tags, and template files. An initial HEAD file that references the HEAD of the master branch is also created.

In order to choose which file to add:
git add pinwei.py
- this will add pinwei python file to the local repository and to the staging area.
By typing a ".", it will add all files and folders within the directory including subdirectories.

By typing git status:
You get to see what files have been added to the staging area.

we'll see this prompt:
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#  new file:   pinwei.py

to commit the files:
press git commit -m "this is pinwei.py" <--- this sallows you write a message about what this file is.

### add this if its a new repo.
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/REPO_NAME.git

$ git push origin master
-> this will push your file to github.


### Adding files


You continue adding files:

git add my_one_file_to_add.rb


git add .


git status

git commit -m "I am commiting new updates to my project"


git push origin master


By using the terminal github on gitbash its easier to move your files from the terminal up to github.


We can also use the branch to create new versions.

git checkout -b branchname.
## this will allow you to create new versions of the file. this will only make changes to the file you work on.

git checkout master

### this allows you go bak to your master branch.

git check out branch ### allows you back to the branch.


### at the branch, you can use 

git pull origin master
### this allows you to pull your data from master.

git checkout branchname

### this allows you to see what branch are you merging with the master.

git merge master 

### this allow you to merge master in to branch.
git checkout master

###this is to checkout master
git merge branchname 

git push origin master

### this allows you to push updated file int o cloud.
