####Classess
A class is a definition, like the blueprint of a house. A blueprint is a detailed model of a
building. It may show you how to build your house, but you can’t live in a blueprint. Instead,
you must build the house, following the plan in the blueprint before you can move in. Similarly,
in some cases, you must instantiate an object, based on the definition contained in
the class before you can use it.
Another way to approach this is to think of a class as an idea and an object as the instantiation
of that idea. For example, a class is like the idea of a German shepherd, whereas an
object is my German shepherd named Buster.
There are several parts to a class. Two core parts are attributes and methods.


Attributes
As mentioned, classes represent real-world
entities such as a vehicle or person. Attributes
within a class define the properties of that class. For instance, a vehicle class might have
attributes such as make, model, color, and VIN. These properties define what’s unique
about each vehicle. There are two types of attributes that Python supports that we will
cover in this lesson: instance attributes and class attributes
Objects
We use classes as a blueprint for creating objects. For example, we know in the real world
what represents a car (a vehicle with four wheels, doors, engine, and so on). If we wanted to
create a certain type of car, we would use the basic prototype of a car (the class) along with
the attributes associated with that class (four wheels, doors, engines) and create various
instances or copies of that class (a midsize car, a truck, an SUV). In making these copies, we
call the class to instantiate objects, which represent concrete realizations of the class.
Once we have defined a class, we can use it to create instances of the class (called
objects). We do this by setting the name of our instance variable equal to the name of the
class followed by parentheses. For example, if we have a class for a person called Person,
we can create an instance called p of that class with the following snippet:
