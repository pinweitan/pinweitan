##Create a directory named logs.

mkdir logs

##Move the log output from the fixGenerator script into the logs directory. (Be sure the script has finished before doing this.)

mv fixlog20220723033318.log ./logs	

##From the command line, replace all instances of MTHREE in the file with M3 and put the output into a new file named fixlog2.log in the logs directory.

sed 's/MTHREE/M3/' fixlog20220723033318.log > fixlog2.log

##Run a command to pull all fill messages from fixlog2.log and put the output into a new logfile named fills.log. (You may need to look up how to tell if a message is a fill.)

grep 39=2 fixlog2.log > fills.log		

##Run a command to pull all cancel acknowledgement messages (39=4) from fixlog2.log into a new log named cancels.log in the same directory.

grep 39=4 fixlog2.log > cancels.log

##Run a command to create a new log file named partialFills.log and add the partial fills from fills.log to the new file.

grep 39=1 fills.log > partialFills.log

##Use awk to create a new file out of the partial fill log that has the following tags only: Symbol (55); orderID (11); side(54); fill price (31); fill quantity (32); execution id (17). Name the file parsedPartialFills.log and make sure you print the columns in the order listed here.

awk '{print $1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6}' partialFillslog > parsedPartialFills.log	

##Using an editor, remove the first part of every fix tag (so you are left with the value only) and turn the file into a comma separated list with no spaces. This is how you might have to get a file ready to send to a trader.

vi parsedPartialFills.log
:%s/55=//g | %s/11=//g | %s/54=//g | %s/31=//g | %s/32=//g | %s/17=//g
sed 's/;\/,/g/' parsedPartialFills.log 

##In the file, add a row of column headers separated by commas. The headers should be Symbol, OrderID, Side, Price, Qty, and ExecID.
	
i-
Symbol,OrderID,Side,Price,Qty,ExecID

##Make a copy of the cancels file and name it cancels2.log.

cp cancels.log cancels2.log

##Open the cancels2.log file in an editor. Find the first symbol (tag 55) in the first line and add the letter A to the beginning of the value. (If it was 55=GOOG, it will become 55=AGOOG.)

:g/55=/ s/$/ A/g

##Run a difference between the original cancels file and the new file you just edited.

diff cancels.log cancels2.log

#Now run the history command and put it into an output file named name.YYMMDD.module10 in the directory specified by your instructor.
history > pinwei.220726.module10
