Incident Management Summary



INCIDENT MANAGEMENT

Introduction to Incident Management
Raising Incident > Fixing > Response Team > Resolve



What is Incident Management?
• Structured approach to incident response
• Adapted from Incident Command System
 Used by emergency response organizations for
natural disasters
 Provides a clear and scalable process
 Provides clear roles and responsibilities
• Enhances
 Control
 Coordination
 Communication

Incident Management Process
01)Identify key roles and chain of command 
02)Define responsibilites
3)Capture response efforts for future analysi and learning
4) Communciation

Avoid Terms
1）Codes
2) Acronyms
3) DSL
Hard for to communicate across channels on what is happening.
Managemnt by objectives:
1)Cover specified timeframe
2)Be proactive towards resolving
3)Assign responsibilites

Key Resource Mangement

Resource Identification > Adding subject amtter experts to response team > Plannig for additional physical IT based resources



-Issue assignments in a specific and timeboxed manner

-Monitoring the results of the incident tasks

Incident Management Key Roles
Incident Manager
Deputy
Scribe

Operations Lead
Communications Lead
Planning Lead

Incident Commander
Responsible for overall coordination
• Keeps incident moving towards resolution
Coordinates all the other roles
• De facto holder of any roles not delegated to
others
Delegates tasks
• Should not be personally making changes
Only role always filled

Scribe
Assists IC
• Captures communication
• Captures actions
• Captures discussion from
conference bridge
Use visible communication tool
• Chatroom (Slack/Teams/etc)
• Google docs
Focus on capturing all information
for future use

Operations Lead
Works with the IC
• Develop theories about what is broken and why
• Recommend changes to the IC
• Coordinate the operation team's efforts to
restore the service
Makes sure changes are made in a controlled
manner
Makes sure that only operation teams are making
changes to the system
Brings in subject matter experts (SMEs) to assist

Communications Lead
Communications are critical
• Internal
• External
Periodic updates
• Status page
• Social media
• Direct communication
May be delegated to maintain incident
documentation
• Communication
• Post incident analysis

Planning Lead
Supports OL and IC
• Capturing long-term issues
• Creating tickets
• Arranging handoffs
• Tracking system divergence from SLO
Supporting Operations teams
• Ordering food

SME On-Call Responsibilities
• Familiarize yourself with the other roles
• Join the incident communications channel ASAP
• Offer theories and suggests
• Support decisions are made by the Incident Commander
• Keep focus on resolving the incident
• Leave the incident channel when asked

Managing Incidents effectively

1)When to deal with incident
2)Identifying impacts
3)Incident management behavior


When to deal with an accident:

1)Requires immediate and dedicated effort to resolve
  determine incident level and impact
 2) deal with incident asap when 
 SLI indicates current failure to meet SLO
 
Declare incident immediately.

Incident response behavior:

1)Deviate from normal ops
2)Response team is the ultimate authority.

POSTMORTEMS

Objective:
Failure is an opportunity for improvement.

What went right?
What went wrong?

To Blame or not to blame:

Human's tendency to look for who to blame.
Its not the person who failed, its the system that failed.
If system is not correct, incident will happen again.
Focus on system that make a repeat failure less liekly.


Continuos Improvement:
Could this happen again?

Collaboration:

Boost team communication
Open discussion of incident

Blameless postmortem process
1)Embrace Risk
2)Capture information during incident response efforts

Problem Statement > Impact Staement > Detection > Timeline > Root Causes > Corrective Actions > Share the Postmortem > Blameless culture

Embracing Risk, Feedback and Fatigue
(1) Incidents will occur: Plan for them
                          Practice response procedure
(2) Error budgets
                        Change velocity
                        
(3) Opportunity for improvement
Avoid heroics

Failure when complexity of system guarantees hardware fialure.

Security attacks occur: Those that do know they have been attacked.
                        Those do not know they have been attacked.
Databases will get corrupted

Components get updated.

Alert Fatigue： On Call ROtation
How to provide 24x7 service.
Is it really required

Is support centralized or global?

Heroics:
Attraction of acclaim for saving the day
Sets expectations

Alert Fatigue:

Common when systems are at an edge point.

Monitoring cycles alert same issue
False positive alerts

Frequently leads to ignored alerts
It will self-heal.


Continuos Improvment
(1)Automation
2 Documentation
3 Reudcing Toil
4 Update SLO
5 Update monitoring
6 Update alerts

Automation:
Manual tasks vs toil
Automation not automatic

Documentation: 
Need to be kept updated:
Post Mortems
ENgineered improvmeents
Better Procedures

Update Alertss:
Eliminate False Positives
Improve information that accompanies alert point to likely resources for faster fix
Assign alerts to automate ticket generation.
