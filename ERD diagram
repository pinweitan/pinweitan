A well-designed ERD includes all of the following information:

The tables required by the database, including the name of each table
A list of fields contained in each table
Metadata about each field, including the name of the field, its data type, and whether or not it is nullable
Identification of all primary and foreign key fields
How each table is related to each other

Assuming we create a table

Relationships

Contact                                 Phone
PK Contact ID INT                     PK PHONE ID INT
  FIRSTNAME VARCHAR(25) ------->       PHONE NUMBER
  LASTNAME VARCHAR (25)                 PHONETYPE ID
    Address                              CONTACT ID INT
    
    
  Essentially this means, if you happened to find a phone number which is a foreign key, it will be refered back to table contact which is the primary key
  
  
  MANY TO MANY R/S
  
 A many-to-many relationship occurs when multiple records in a table are associated with multiple records in another table. For example, a many-to-many relationship exists between customers and products: customers can purchase various products, and products can be purchased by many customers.
  
Relational database systems usually don't allow you to implement a direct many-to-many relationship between two tables. Consider the example of keeping track of invoices. If there were many invoices with the same invoice number and one of your customers inquired about that invoice number, you wouldn't know which number they were referring to. This is one reason for assigning a unique value to each invoice.

To avoid this problem, you can break the many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many relationships by using a third table, called a join table. Each record in a join table includes a match field that contains the value of the primary keys of the two tables it joins. (In the join table, these match fields are foreign keys.) These foreign key fields are populated with data as records in the join table are created from either table it joins.

A typical example of a many-to many relationship is one between students and classes. A student can register for many classes, and a class can include many students.
